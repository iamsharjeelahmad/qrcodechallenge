### What I learned

I replicated the design as close as possible to the concept design. This gave me an idea of what actual frontend projects look like. I had to analyze the requirements, and try to achieve the required result that is a near replicate of the original design. Once the development was completed, I learned to how properly use Git on my code and comitted it to my GitHub repo. Afterwards, I uploaded it on netlify for wider use. Now I'm just about to commit this revised README file as well.

### Continued development

I will continue to enhance my stying skills, use Semantic HTML5 Markup and will try to use JS to add dynamic features and functionality.
